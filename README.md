# Colors
Milestones:

1) Clean up/rewrite code from colors prototype to allow easier additions

2) Implement genetic selection algorithm

  a) add a way to save cellular automata rulesets
  
  b) create an algorithm to combine parent rulesets into children
  
    i) create infrastructure to preset children to user and have them pick which become parents
    
  c) tune above to make it prettier
  
3) Implement music sync

  a) get input from microphone or system sounds
  
  b) FFT the raw data
  
  c) figure out how to apply it to the cells to make the whole thing prettier
  
  
Measurements of success

1) Is it prettier than before?

2) Did I learn about genetic algorithms?

3) Did I learn about FFT?
